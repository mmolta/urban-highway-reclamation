                    initiaves in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century paved highways through American cities to facilitate connection to
                    developing suburbs. Under the name of "reducing urban blight", low-income and
                    predominantly black neighborhoods were destroyed to make space for the new highways. Construction tore up
                    communities, divided cities, and reduced the air quality of the surrounding areas. The priorities of cities began
                    to change as the people living in them became second class to the cars moving throughout them. As the highways 
                    from urban renewal efforts begin to decay, there are new opportunities to re-imagine cities
                    as safe, healthy, productive spaces for people to coexist.

                <p>
                    There is optimism for change because there is no cost-free solution to dealing with urban highways.
                    Cities must either pay to repair them or pay to remove them, and in many cases it costs less to 
                    tear down than to repair. For example, the $45 million Park East Freeway removal in Milwaukee represented 
                    "<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_profiles/wi_park_east_freeway.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        a big savings over the $100 million that it would have cost to rebuild the freeway
                    </a>". By contrast,
                    "<a href="https://reconnectaustin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        2008's Katy Freeway expansion took 3 years to complete and cost $2.8 billion.
                    </a>".
                    Not only can repairing or expanding freeways be more expensive, but decades of urban planning research have shown,
                    through adding lanes to roads often increases travels time due to a
                    <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        induced demand

                    Furthermore, the price of fixing an urban freeway doesn't necessarily help the problem they were intended
                    to solve in the first place. Decades of data on urban planning has "induced demand" "Adding lanes to existing roads creates an induced demand - more lanes attract more drivers; more drivers mean
                    just as much or even more congestion.

                <p><strong>Last updated on December 15th, 2022</strong></p>

                <p>
                    Projects were from the extent of my research, some may be missing. Figures were
                    calculations based on reported numbers in articles and on official websites, everything
                    on this page is an estimate. The point of this project is to give a general overview
                    on the status of Urban Highway Reclamation and make a case that it is a strong area for 
                    social and economic development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the sake of time, <strong>capping projects were not considred</strong>. I chose to 
                    constrain the scope of this website to projects that removed parts or entire freeways from
                    an urban environment. Freeway caps are a popular solution that can help reconnect divided neighborhoods.
                    An evolution of this website would addd them to the map.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This page was built in two weeks and in order to prioritize research and quality of content, 
                    there are some sacrifices on technical aspects that had to be made. For one, point clustering 
                    on the map would be nice to have but is not included. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many proposed or discussed projects were not chosen for this website because the conversations are 
                    too early stage, too theoretical, or seem to have been abandoned. Projects like I-275 in Tampa, the Claiborne
                    Expressway (etc., add links). They may eventually become useful but I want to create this website as a repository
                    of projects that are completed, close to completed, or seriosly in consideration. Despite a lot of great work and 
                    community, grassroots organizations, a fair number of projects like the Tampa and other ones don't make the cut for 
                    this page because there is simply too much uncertainty around their future.
