                    initiatives in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century paved highways through American cities to facilitate connection to
                    developing suburbs. The movement became known as "urban renewal" and, with the justification of reducing "urban blight",
                    low-income and predominantly black neighborhoods were destroyed to make space for highways. Construction tore up
                    communities, divided cities, and reduced the air quality of the surrounding areas.
                    The priorities of urban spaces began to change and the people living in them became secondary to the cars moving
                    throughout them.

                    <strong>
                        As the highways built during "urban renewal" fall into disrepair, there are opportunities to re-imagine healthier, better
                        connected cities where the needs of people living within them matter more than the movement of goods and people
                        through them.

                    Cities must either pay to repair these highways or pay to remove them, and it often costs less to 
                    tear down than to repair. For example, the $45 million Park East Freeway removal in Milwaukee cost less than half of the
                    <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_profiles/wi_park_east_freeway.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        $100 million that it would have cost to rebuild the freeway
                    </a>.
                    Furthermore, the fear of increased congestion caused by removing urban freeways has been repeatedly proven to be misplaced,
                    with the earthquake-induced removal of the
                    <a href="https://www.cnu.org/what-we-do/build-great-places/embarcadero-freeway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Embarcadero Freeway</a>
                    serving as a case study. As the dataset of successful projects grows, the evidence in favor of removing urban highways
                    becomes increasingly difficult to ignore:

                <p>
                    It is difficult to quantify the impact of urban highway removal due to the lack of available data and the
                    broad range of qualitative benefits. Dollars returned on investment do not accurately capture the social benefits
                    including quality of life improvements. Many projects do not report the environmental impact although the ones that
                    do show significant improvements. (link here).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The logistics and scope of considerations when removing urban highways are vast.
                    The <a href="https://www.cnu.org/our-projects/highways-boulevards/principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congress for New Urbanism</a>

                    have outlined principles that focus on policy action as well as community, environmental and economic guidelines for effective
                    highway removal.

                    The following section of this page will provide a high-level overview of completed, developing and actively planned urban highway
                    removal projects. The list is not comprehensive because it imposes constraints on project type, as well as proposal type. For example,
                    highway caps are not considered and neither are grassroots campaigns that have not resulted in official adoption of a plan.

                <p>
                    Projects were from the extent of my research, some may be missing and some were omitted intentionally. 
                    Viewing CNU's list of <a href="">highways-to-boulevards</a> shows a greater number of completed projects 
                    than on this website. I found that some were still in development and needed to be reclassified, while some 
                    did not meet my criteria (i.e. caps) and some of the planned projects seem to have stalled or been outright
                    rejected by their local government. The point of this website is to show projects that have happened or will 
                    certainly happen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many proposed or discussed projects were not chosen for this website because the conversations are 
                    too early stage, too theoretical, or seem to have been abandoned. Projects like I-275 in Tampa, the Claiborne
                    Expressway (etc., add links). They may eventually become useful but I want to create this website as a repository
                    of projects that are completed, close to completed, or seriosly in consideration. Despite a lot of great work and 
                    community, grassroots organizations and hopefully one day they can end up on this page. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Figures were calculations based on reported numbers in articles and on official websites, everything
                    on this page is an estimate. The point of this project is to give a general overview
                    on the status of Urban Highway Reclamation and make a case that it is a strong area for 
                    social, environmental, and economic development.
                </p>

                <p id="constraints">
                    I chose to constrain the scope of this website to projects that removed parts or entire freeways from
                    an urban environment, and so projects that put caps on freeways were not considered. This is not to say they
                    are not useful and do not have positive benefits. I made a personal choice to not include them because they
                    seem to me like a half measure that put a band-aid over the problem and will incur maintenance costs and other
                    degrade over time.

                    This page was built in two weeks and in order to prioritize research and quality of content, 
                    there are some sacrifices on technical aspects that had to be made. For one, point clustering 
                    on the map would be nice to have but is not included. Map filters did not make the cut either.
