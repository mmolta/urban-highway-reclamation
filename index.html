                    initiaves in the 1950's and 1960's paved highways through city centers with the goal of increased economic
                    prosperity by connecting suburbs to cities. What happened was a disturbing pattern of destorying historicaly
                    black neighborhoods to build highways that have since fallen under disrepair and rendered once vibrant downtown areas
                    into desolate, dangerous areas. They've divided cities, created unsafe neighborhoods and contributed to the slow
                    decay of urban centers.

                <p>
                    In the past 30 years, interest in removing urban freeawys has grown as more and more successful projects show the 
                    clear social, environmental and economic benefits. Creating space for communities.

                    "Adding lanes to existing roads creates an induced demand - more lanes attract more drivers; more drivers mean
                    just as much or even more congestion.
                    
                    2008's Katy Freeway expansion took 3 years to complete and cost $2.8 billion. It added 3 extra lanes to Houston's
                    stretch of I-10. The result? A 30% increase in travel time."

                    While the numbers speak for themselves, the impact of urban highway reclamation projects go
                    far beyond numbers. In creating new community spaces, cities are able to develop in previously impossible
                    ways.

                    Talk about the opportunity cost of NOT removing them. Most of these highways were old and in need of major repairs. For example, 
                    the $45 million Park East Freeway removal in Milwaukee represented 
                    "a big savings over the $100 million that it would have cost to rebuild the freeway, which was 30 years old and in need of reconstruction."
                    (<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_profiles/wi_park_east_freeway.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>.)

                    Same deal for Rochester's Inner Loop:
                    "Maintenance of this portion of the Inner Loop would exceed the cost of filling the loop in and creating an at-grade street, while providing none of the benefits"
                    (<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_profiles/ny_freeway_to_boulvard_rochester.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bring up the concerns of gentrification. Low income neighborhoods were destroyed to build the freeways and the surrounding
                    area became worthless land. Land value goes up once the freeway is removed and it's crucial for these projects to not
                    double down on mistakes of the past and prioritize people alrady living there. It would be a disaster to remove the freeway 
                    and price out locals.

                <p><strong>Last updated on December 15th, 2022</strong></p>

                <p>
                    Projects were from the extent of my research, some may be missing. Figures were
                    calculations based on reported numbers in articles and on official websites, everything
                    on this page is an estimate. The point of this project is to give a general overview
                    on the status of Urban Highway Reclamation and make a case that it is a strong area for 
                    social and economic development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the sake of time, <strong>capping projects were not considred</strong>. I chose to 
                    constrain the scope of this website to projects that removed parts or entire freeways from
                    an urban environment. Freeway caps are a popular solution that can help reconnect divided neighborhoods.
                    An evolution of this website would addd them to the map.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This page was built in two weeks and in order to prioritize research and quality of content, 
                    there are some sacrifices on technical aspects that had to be made. For one, point clustering 
                    on the map would be nice to have but is not included. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many proposed or discussed projects were not chosen for this website because the conversations are 
                    too early stage, too theoretical, or seem to have been abandoned. Projects like I-275 in Tampa, the Claiborne
                    Expressway (etc., add links). They may eventually become useful but I want to create this website as a repository
                    of projects that are completed, close to completed, or seriosly in consideration. Despite a lot of great work and 
                    community, grassroots organizations, a fair number of projects like the Tampa and other ones don't make the cut for 
                    this page because there is simply too much uncertainty around their future.
