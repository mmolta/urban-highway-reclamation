                <h3 class="main-h3">The problem</h3>
                <p>
                    City planning initiatives in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century paved highways through American cities to facilitate connection to
                    developing suburbs. The movement became known as "urban renewal" and, with the justification of reducing "urban blight",
                    low-income and predominantly Black neighborhoods were destroyed to make space for highways. Construction tore up
                    communities, divided cities, and reduced the air quality of the surrounding areas.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The priorities of urban spaces began to change and the people living in cities became secondary to the cars moving
                    throughout them. As the highways built during "urban renewal" fall into disrepair, citizens and elected officials have
                    new opportunities to redistribute space dominated by vehicles and transform what it means to live and move in a city.
                </p>

                <h3 class="main-h3">The opportunities</h3>
                <p>
                    Managing traffic was a primary argument in favor of building, expanding, and maintaining urban highways but history has
                    shown the opposite to be true.
                    The earthquake-induced removal of the
                    <a href="https://www.cnu.org/what-we-do/build-great-places/embarcadero-freeway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Embarcadero Freeway</a>
                    and the collapse of the 
                    <a href="http://www.preservenet.com/freeways/FreewaysWestSide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westside Freeway</a>
                    are case studies on the inefficacy of urban highways. These forced removals inpsired other cities to consider alternatives to 
                    maintaining highways.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    There is no cost-free option to dealing with failing infrastructure, and therein lies the opportunity to undo mistakes of the past. 
                    For example, the $45 million Park East Freeway removal in Milwaukee cost less than half of the
                    <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_profiles/wi_park_east_freeway.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        $100 million that it would have cost to rebuild the freeway
                    </a>. The project revitalized downtown Milwaukee, created three new neighborhoods, and generated over a billion dollars in 
                    investment all while costing $55 million less than keeping the existing structure that provided none of the benefits.

                <h3 class="main-h3">The benefits</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to contextualize the numbers associated with urban highway removal. Private investment statistics tell a positive yet incomplete 
                    story. Ultimately, the effects of urban highway removal are more qualitative than quantitative. The quality of life benefits are continuous and
                    generational. As communities rebuild themselves, the city as a whole becomes stronger and more attractive. New connections and patterns of 
                    social and cultural exchange take time to develop and establish themselves. Physical and mental health benefits from improved air quality take time
                    to manifest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The overall benefit of removing urban highways is creating safe, clean, accessible space in which people can thrive. Redistributing the space dominated by automobiles
                    allows citizens to reclaim their space and 
                    It is therefore crucial to be conscious of equity when planning beyond urban highways.

                    highway removal.

                        City planning movement in the 1950's and 1960's, championed by Robert Moses, that pushed for the construction
                        of highways through city centers. The idea was to facilitate movement through cities into suburbs and other cities 
                        and also to reduce traffic. Undoing the harms caused by urban renewal is the focus of this website.

                <p>
                    Projects were from the extent of my research, some may be missing and some were omitted intentionally. 
                    Viewing CNU's list of
                    <a href="https://www.cnu.org/sites/default/files/CNU%20Highways%20to%20Boulevards%20Fact%20Sheet%202020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highways to boulevard fact sheet</a>
                    shows a greater number of completed projects 
                    than on this website. I found that some were still in development and needed to be reclassified, some
                    of the planned projects seem to have been outright rejected by their local government and others are too 
                    early in the planning/activism stage. I also did not include highway capping projects because, while they do reconnect neighborhoods 
                    in the short term, they do not remove the problem and seem to create a similar set of maintenance issues. How long can they stay safe, 
                    how will construction on top of them, root erosion and other factors impact the safety of drivers underneath them?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The point of this website is to show projects that have happened or will certainly happen. I also wanted to focus on 
                    projects that met sustainable criteria in every sense of the word. The maintenance concerns associated with capping projects
                    and the lack of time available to fully research their long term effects led me to exclude them. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Figures were calculations based on reported numbers in articles and on official websites, everything
                    on this page is an estimate. The point of this project is to give a general overview
                    on the status of Urban Highway Reclamation and make a case that it is a strong area for 
                    social, environmental, and economic development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This page was built in two weeks and in order to prioritize research and quality of content, 
                    there are some sacrifices on technical aspects that had to be made. For one, point clustering 
                    on the map would be nice to have but is not included. Map filters did not make the cut either.
