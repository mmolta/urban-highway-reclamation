                    initiaves in the 1950's and 1960's paved highways through American cities with the goal of economic
                    prosperity and better traffic management. Under the name of "reducing urban blight", low-income and
                    predominantly black neighborhoods were destroyed to make space for the new highways. Construction tore up
                    communities, divided cities, and reduced the air quality of the surrounding areas. As the legacy of urban
                    renewal permeates into 21<sup>1st</sup> century America, many cities are questioning

                    As the higways from urban renewal began to decay in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century,
                    cities were faced with expensive bills for upkeep. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, the  Most of these highways were old and in need of major repairs. For example, 
                    the $45 million Park East Freeway removal in Milwaukee represented 
                    "a big savings over the $100 million that it would have cost to rebuild the freeway, which was 30 years old and in need of reconstruction."

                    The 
                    "Maintenance of this portion of the Inner Loop would exceed the cost of filling the loop in and creating an at-grade street, while providing none of the benefits"

                <p>
                    "Adding lanes to existing roads creates an induced demand - more lanes attract more drivers; more drivers mean
                    just as much or even more congestion.
                    
                    2008's Katy Freeway expansion took 3 years to complete and cost $2.8 billion. It added 3 extra lanes to Houston's
                    stretch of I-10. The result? A 30% increase in travel time."

                    The impact of urban highway reclamation projects go far dollars gained through tax revenue or private investment - 
                    although those numbers are significant.

                    It is of course not as simple as removing an urban freeway and reaping the rewards.

                <p><strong>Last updated on December 15th, 2022</strong></p>

                <p>
                    Projects were from the extent of my research, some may be missing. Figures were
                    calculations based on reported numbers in articles and on official websites, everything
                    on this page is an estimate. The point of this project is to give a general overview
                    on the status of Urban Highway Reclamation and make a case that it is a strong area for 
                    social and economic development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the sake of time, <strong>capping projects were not considred</strong>. I chose to 
                    constrain the scope of this website to projects that removed parts or entire freeways from
                    an urban environment. Freeway caps are a popular solution that can help reconnect divided neighborhoods.
                    An evolution of this website would addd them to the map.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This page was built in two weeks and in order to prioritize research and quality of content, 
                    there are some sacrifices on technical aspects that had to be made. For one, point clustering 
                    on the map would be nice to have but is not included. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many proposed or discussed projects were not chosen for this website because the conversations are 
                    too early stage, too theoretical, or seem to have been abandoned. Projects like I-275 in Tampa, the Claiborne
                    Expressway (etc., add links). They may eventually become useful but I want to create this website as a repository
                    of projects that are completed, close to completed, or seriosly in consideration. Despite a lot of great work and 
                    community, grassroots organizations, a fair number of projects like the Tampa and other ones don't make the cut for 
                    this page because there is simply too much uncertainty around their future.
