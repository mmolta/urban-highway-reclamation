                    initiaves in the 1950's and 1960's promised to raise the standard of living and increase economic
                    prosperity by connecting suburbs to cities. In reality they were just a way to destroy black neighborhoods and
                    allow white flight to happen. They've divided cities, created unsafe neighborhoods and contributed to the slow
                    decay of urban centers.

                <p>
                    In the past 30 years, interest in removing urban freeawys has grown as more and more successful projects show the 
                    clear social, environmental and economic benefits. Creating space for communities.

                    While the numbers speak for themselves, the impact of urban highway reclamation projects go
                    far beyond numbers. In creating new community spaces, cities are able to develop in previously impossible
                    ways.

                    Talk about the opportunity cost of NOT removing them. Most of these highways were old and in need of major repairs. For example, 
                    the $45 million Park East Freeway removal in Milwaukee represented 
                    "a big savings over the $100 million that it would have cost to rebuild the freeway, which was 30 years old and in need of reconstruction."
                    (<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_profiles/wi_park_east_freeway.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>.)

                    Same deal for Rochester's Inner Loop:
                    "Maintenance of this portion of the Inner Loop would exceed the cost of filling the loop in and creating an at-grade street, while providing none of the benefits"
                    (<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_profiles/ny_freeway_to_boulvard_rochester.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bring up the concerns of gentrification. Low income neighborhoods were destroyed to build the freeways and the surrounding
                    area became worthless land. Land value goes up once the freeway is removed and it's crucial for these projects to not
                    double down on mistakes of the past and prioritize people alrady living there. It would be a disaster to remove the freeway 
                    and price out locals.

                <p>
                    MAJOR ISSUE: my "return" numbers don't capture the full story and The Big Dig fucks up the 
                    cost vs return ratios. Most of what I find are numbers for private investment but what about 
                    jobs created and recurring money back?

                <p>
                    I did this shit in two weeks it was last updated on December 15th, 2022.
                    Projects were from the extent of my research, some may be missing. Figures were
                    calculations based on reported numbers in articles and on official websites, everything
                    on this page is an estimate. The point of this project is to give a general overview
                    on the status of Urban Highway Reclamation and make a case that it is a strong area for 
                    social and economic development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a strong environmental component to this work as well but it was difficult to find 
                    consistent data sources and environmental reports for the projects and so it was not included.
