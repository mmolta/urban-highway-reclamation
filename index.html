                <p>
                    City planning initiatives in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century paved highways through American cities to facilitate connection to
                    developing suburbs. The movement became known as "urban renewal" and, with the justification of reducing "urban blight",
                    low-income and predominantly Black neighborhoods were destroyed to make space for highways. Construction tore up
                    communities, divided cities, and had a significant environmental impact on the surrounding areas.

                    <p>
                        The priorities of urban spaces began to change and the people living in cities became secondary to the cars moving
                        throughout them. As the highways built during "urban renewal" fall into disrepair, citizens and elected officials have
                        new opportunities to redistribute space dominated by vehicles and transform what it means to live and move in a city.

                    <p>

                        in Milwaukee cost less than half of the $100 million that it would have cost to rebuild the freeway.
                        The project revitalized downtown Milwaukee, created three new neighborhoods, and generated over a billion dollars in 
                        investment.

                        It is therefore crucial to be conscious of equity when planning beyond urban highways.

                        The phenomenon of adding more lanes to a freeway and ending up with more traffic. This happens because
                        more lanes invites more cars which creates more traffic.

                        <strong>Urban Renewal</strong>
                        <br>
                        City planning movement in the 1950's and 1960's, championed by Robert Moses, that pushed for the construction
                        of highways through city centers. The idea was to facilitate movement through cities into suburbs and other cities 
                        and also to reduce traffic. Undoing the harms caused by urban renewal is the focus of this website.

                        At surface level, urban blight refers to rundown parts of cities. The reality of the phrase exposes deep, structural
                        and institutional inequalities in America that have resulted in a strong correlation between areas of urban blight and predominantly
                        Black neighborhoods.
