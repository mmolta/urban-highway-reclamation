# urban-highway-reclamation
What is the point of this?
    - awareness
    - Dispel the myth of cost. People only see the price tag and don't know enough about the return on investment. Both economically and in
    quality of life, all of these projects pay for themselves
    - Thesis statement: This can happen in ANY city.
        - you don't need to be wealthy, or elite to do the work and see the benefits and improvements.
        - Greenville, carolina bridge project has the best quote. The town was dying, downtown was decaying, development was happening

## CNU main source
Helpful repository that has most of the information, but struggles to effectively communicate because:
    - scope is too wide
    - inconsistent information
        - The navigational path of /what-we-do/build-great-places/project-name/ has helpful facts, figures and stories of projects
        but isn't organized in a useful way. You have all projects, loosely assocaited, hard af to navigate
        - The navigational path /our-projects/highways-boulevards/completed-h2b-projects/ seems like it would be the repository but 
        it struggles because the project pages lack the salient facts that the what-we-do version does. It's also not comprehensive due
        to an arbitrary constratint of definitions. Only a specific type of freeway removal is on this page, partial segments and other
        similar themed projects are not. 
    - overall, the website has all the information you need but it requries a lot of digging. It's scattered, disorganized and inconsistent
    in the way it presents what you need. This shows the need for my project. A single repository of all urban freeway removal projects, on
    one page, with consistent information. I will add filters for section/full removal etc.
    - for example: Harbor Drive in Portland, Oregon, has a version within each subpage:
        - https://www.cnu.org/highways-boulevards/model-cities/portland
        - https://www.cnu.org/what-we-do/build-great-places/harbor-drive
        - Both of these page have the EXACT SAME body content. The /what-we-do version has the facts and figures on the right. The redundancy
        here is pointless and unneeded. 
        - The IA is baffling. The /highways-boulevards/ landing is easy to find, straightforward and well organized. The projects within that
        are lacking. Meanwhile, the /what-we-do/ landing is a useless info dump. It's just a list of all projects of all types, paginated with
        no organization or ability to filter specific projects. If you can somehow find the right project, the content is better.
            - The seemingly only way to find good projects wihin /what-we-do/ is a group of three similar projects at the bottom of each project.
            It's a roulette.
