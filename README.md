# urban-highway-reclamation

## CNU main source
Helpful repository that has most of the information, but struggles to effectively communicate because:
    - scope is too wide
    - inconsistent information
        - The navigational path of /what-we-do/build-great-places/project-name/ has helpful facts, figures and stories of projects
        but isn't organized in a useful way. You have all projects, loosely assocaited, hard af to navigate
        - The navigational path /our-projects/highways-boulevards/completed-h2b-projects/ seems like it would be the repository but 
        it struggles because the project pages lack the salient facts that the what-we-do version does. It's also not comprehensive due
        to an arbitrary constratint of definitions. Only a specific type of freeway removal is on this page, partial segments and other
        similar themed projects are not. 
    - overall, the website has all the information you need but it requries a lot of digging. It's scattered, disorganized and inconsistent
    in the way it presents what you need. This shows the need for my project. A single repository of all urban freeway removal projects, on
    one page, with consistent information. I will add filters for section/full removal etc.
    - for example: Harbor Drive in Portland, Oregon, has a version within each subpage:
        - https://www.cnu.org/highways-boulevards/model-cities/portland
        - https://www.cnu.org/what-we-do/build-great-places/harbor-drive
        - Both of these page have the EXACT SAME body content. The /what-we-do version has the facts and figures on the right. The redundancy
        here is pointless and unneeded. 
        - The IA is baffling. The /highways-boulevards/ landing is easy to find, straightforward and well organized. The projects within that
        are lacking. Meanwhile, the /what-we-do/ landing is a useless info dump. It's just a list of all projects of all types, paginated with
        no organization or ability to filter specific projects. If you can somehow find the right project, the content is better.
